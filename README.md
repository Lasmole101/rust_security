This project is an implmentation of various security algorithims in rust with the objective of being as simple and self conttained as possible.

I started this project primarily as a method of learning how these algorithms work and learning to work in rust

Testing:

- Unit tests are done inside each module (see big_int as an example)
- Algorithm testing is done against openssl as a standard
